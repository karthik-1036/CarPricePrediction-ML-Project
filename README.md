# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction (India-Specific Dataset)

A machine learning project that predicts the resale price of used cars in India based on various specifications like make, model, fuel type, kilometers driven, engine capacity, and more. Built to simulate real-world deployment with a clean architecture, model pipeline, and dynamic Streamlit UI.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Car resale prices vary due to numerous factors such as brand, model, fuel type, mileage, transmission, and more. Accurately predicting the price of a second-hand car can benefit:
- Buyers looking for fair deals 💰
- Dealers setting price benchmarks 📊
- Platforms offering instant car valuations ⚙️

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a regression model to predict resale price of used cars
- Handle categorical, numerical, and textual features efficiently
- Create an interactive frontend using Streamlit
- Prepare for real-world ML deployment (MLOps-ready)

---

## 🧠 Features Used

- Make & Model  
- Year of Manufacture  
- Fuel Type & Transmission  
- Owner Type & Seller Type  
- Max BHP & Torque (with RPMs)  
- Engine Capacity, Dimensions  
- Color, Location, Seating Capacity  
- Kilometers Driven
